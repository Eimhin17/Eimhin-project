# Image Display Fix Summary

## Problem
After updating to Expo 54, images stopped displaying throughout the app. The error logs showed:
```
❌ Image load error: {"error": "The requested URL was not found on this server.", "target": 398}
❌ Image URI: file:///var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/.../ImagePicker/...jpg
❌ Error converting photo to base64: [TypeError: Cannot read property 'Base64' of undefined]
❌ Error converting photo to base64: [Error: Method readAsStringAsync imported from "expo-file-system" is deprecated]
❌ Error converting photo to base64: [Error: File '.../ImagePicker/...jpg' is not readable]
```

## Root Cause
Expo 54 changed how local file URIs (`file://`) are handled. The app was storing and trying to display local file URIs directly, which are no longer supported in the same way. Additionally, the `FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64` API was changed and the `readAsStringAsync` method is deprecated in the main expo-file-system module. After the Expo update, many local file URIs became invalid or unreadable.

## Solution
Created a comprehensive image conversion system that converts local `file://` URIs to base64 data URLs for display while preserving web URLs and data URLs.

### Files Modified

1. **`utils/imageUtils.ts`** (NEW)
   - `convertFileUriToDataUrl()` - Converts single file URI to data URL
   - `convertPhotoArrayToDataUrls()` - Converts array of photo URIs
   - `useConvertedPhotos()` - React hook for photo conversion

2. **`components/ScrollableProfileCard.tsx`**
   - Added photo conversion logic using `useEffect`
   - Updated all Image components to use `convertedPhotos` instead of `profile.photos`
   - Added loading state for photo conversion

3. **`app/edit-profile.tsx`**
   - Added `convertedPhotos` state
   - Updated photo loading logic to convert photos for display
   - Updated Image component to use converted photos

4. **`components/CircularProfilePicture.tsx`**
   - Added file URI conversion in `loadProfilePicture()`
   - Now converts PFP URLs before displaying

### How It Works

1. **Onboarding**: Photos are still converted to base64 during onboarding (existing logic preserved)
2. **Display**: When loading photos from database, they're converted from `file://` URIs to data URLs
3. **Fallback**: If conversion fails, falls back to placeholder image
4. **Performance**: Conversion happens asynchronously with loading states
5. **Legacy API**: Uses `expo-file-system/legacy` import to access the deprecated `readAsStringAsync` method
6. **Encoding Fix**: Uses `FileSystem.EncodingType.Base64` with the legacy API for proper encoding
7. **File Validation**: Checks if files exist and are readable before attempting conversion

### Benefits

- ✅ Fixes image display issues in Expo 54
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing data
- ✅ Preserves web URLs and data URLs (no unnecessary conversion)
- ✅ Graceful fallback for failed conversions
- ✅ Simple and maintainable solution

### Testing

The fix handles:
- `file://` URIs → Converted to base64 data URLs
- `data:` URIs → Passed through unchanged
- `http/https` URLs → Passed through unchanged
- Invalid URIs → Fallback to placeholder

## Usage

The conversion happens automatically in components. No changes needed in existing code that uses these components.

For new components that need to display photos:
```typescript
import { convertFileUriToDataUrl, convertPhotoArrayToDataUrls } from '../utils/imageUtils';

// Single photo
const displayUrl = await convertFileUriToDataUrl(photoUri);

// Multiple photos
const displayUrls = await convertPhotoArrayToDataUrls(photoUris);
```
