# Tinder-Style Card Stack Implementation Test

## Implementation Summary

âœ… **Completed Features:**

1. **TinderCardStack Component** (`/components/TinderCardStack.tsx`)
   - Multi-card stack with visible cards behind current one
   - Smooth animations with spring physics
   - Progressive card scaling and positioning
   - Haptic feedback during swipes
   - Gesture handling for swipe detection

2. **Card Preloader Service** (`/services/cardPreloader.ts`)
   - Background photo URL refreshing
   - Batch preloading of upcoming cards
   - Memory management for optimal performance
   - No loading delays between cards

3. **Updated Home Screen** (`/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`)
   - Integrated TinderCardStack component
   - Removed old single-card gesture handling
   - Streamlined swipe handling with shared logic

## Key Improvements

### **No Loading Time**
- Cards are preloaded in background
- Photo URLs are refreshed before display
- Smooth transitions without delays

### **Tinder-Style Stack Effect**
- Current card at front (100% scale, 100% opacity)
- Second card behind (96% scale, 100% opacity, +12px Y offset)
- Third card behind (92% scale, 50% opacity, +24px Y offset)

### **Enhanced Animations**
- Spring-based physics for natural movement
- Smooth rotation during swipes (max 30 degrees)
- Progressive haptic feedback
- Overlays for like/dislike feedback

### **Performance Optimized**
- Only 3 cards rendered at once
- Background preloading of next 5 cards
- Automatic cleanup of old card states
- Memory-efficient photo management

## Testing Checklist

To test the implementation:

1. **Visual Stack Effect**
   - [ ] Can see current card on top
   - [ ] Can see next card partially behind
   - [ ] Third card visible with reduced opacity

2. **Smooth Swiping**
   - [ ] No loading time when swiping
   - [ ] Cards move smoothly forward
   - [ ] Rotation effects work during swipe

3. **Haptic Feedback**
   - [ ] Progressive haptics during swipe
   - [ ] Different intensities based on distance

4. **Performance**
   - [ ] No lag when switching cards
   - [ ] Photos load quickly
   - [ ] Memory usage remains stable

## Potential Issues to Monitor

1. **Memory Usage**: Monitor if preloading causes memory issues
2. **Photo Loading**: Ensure signed URLs don't expire during use
3. **Animation Performance**: Check for dropped frames on slower devices

## Next Steps

If testing reveals issues:
1. Adjust preloading batch size
2. Fine-tune animation timing
3. Optimize haptic feedback thresholds
