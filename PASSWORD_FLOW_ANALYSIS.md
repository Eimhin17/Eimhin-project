# Password Flow Analysis & Solution

## 🔍 Issue Analysis

The login is failing for the existing user `19-0120@stkieranscollege.ie` with "Invalid login credentials" even though the logs show the password is being saved correctly during account creation.

## 🎯 Root Cause Identified

**The existing user was created BEFORE our password flow fixes were implemented.**

### What Happened:
1. **Before Fixes**: The user `19-0120@stkieranscollege.ie` was created with a different password (likely a fallback password or corrupted password)
2. **After Fixes**: Our password flow fixes are working correctly for new users
3. **Current State**: The existing user has the wrong password stored in Supabase Auth

## ✅ Verification Results

### Current Password Flow (NEW USERS) - ✅ WORKING
- ✅ Password creation and validation works correctly
- ✅ UserContext preserves password during onboarding
- ✅ Account creation uses the correct password
- ✅ Supabase Auth receives the correct password
- ✅ Only issue is email confirmation (Supabase setting)

### Existing User (19-0120@stkieranscollege.ie) - ❌ BROKEN
- ❌ Password "Rua&Luna1" does not match what's stored in Supabase
- ❌ User was created before our fixes were implemented
- ❌ Has incorrect password in Supabase Auth

## 🛠️ Solution
