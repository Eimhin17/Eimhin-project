# Onboarding Flow Reorganization Summary

## New Onboarding Flow Order

The onboarding flow has been reorganized according to the specified phases to create a better user experience and build trust early.

### Phase 1: Core trust & access (absolutely required to join)
1. **Welcome screen** (quick pitch + reassurance: "Only real students. Safe. Verified.")
2. **School Selection** - Enter school
3. **Email Verification** - Enter school email  
4. **Email Code** - Verify email (instant trust â€” they know it's legit)
5. **Password Creation** - Set password
6. **Legal Agreements** - Legal agreements (don't hide this later, it builds credibility early)

ðŸ‘‰ At this point, they're officially "in" and have a skeleton account. Momentum is rolling.

### Phase 2: Identity basics (make them feel like a real person fast)
7. **Basic Details** - Name + DOB (DOB is critical for age restriction & trust)
8. **Gender Selection** - Gender
9. **Photo Upload** - Profile photo upload (put this early â€” faces make the app feel alive, and people stick around if they see themselves in it)

### Phase 3: Match foundation (light but engaging)
10. **Gender Preference** - Gender preference
11. **Looking For** - Looking for friends or dates
12. **Relationship Status** - Relationship status
13. **Debs Preferences** - Debs swaps (go to theirs / bring them to yours)

ðŸ‘‰ Now they have a usable profile â€” they could technically start swiping/browsing. Don't hide all the fun until the bitter end.

### Phase 4: Personality & depth (make it sticky, but optional/skippable at first)
14. **Bio** - Bio (optional, can be skipped)
15. **Interests** - Interests
16. **Profile Prompts** - Profile prompts (fun, TikTok-style vibe, not a chore)

### Phase 5: Engagement hooks
17. **Notifications** - Enable/disable notifications
18. **Dating Intentions** - Dating intentions (short/long term, casual, serious)

### Phase 6: Final setup
19. **Community Guidelines** - Community guidelines + Account Creation

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Created Missing Pages
- **`bio.tsx`** - Optional bio page with character limit and tips
- **`legal-agreements.tsx`** - Terms of service and privacy policy agreement
- **`community-guidelines.tsx`** - Community guidelines with account creation code moved from profile-prompts

### 2. Updated Navigation Flow
- All pages now navigate to the correct next page according to the new phases
- Progress bars updated to reflect the new 17-step flow
- Account creation code moved from `profile-prompts.tsx` to `community-guidelines.tsx`

### 3. Updated Layout File
- `_layout.tsx` reorganized with clear phase comments
- All screen names properly ordered according to the new flow

### 4. Preserved Existing Functionality
- All existing data saving to the profiles table remains unchanged
- Authentication flow remains intact
- All existing UI components and styling preserved

## Benefits of New Flow

1. **Early Trust Building** - School verification and legal agreements upfront
2. **Quick Identity** - Name, DOB, gender, and photo early to make users feel real
3. **Usable Profile** - After Phase 3, users have a complete profile for matching
4. **Optional Depth** - Bio and prompts are skippable but engaging
5. **Clear Completion** - Community guidelines and account creation at the end

## Technical Notes

- All progress bars now show 17 total steps
- Account creation happens only at the very end (community guidelines page)
- The flow maintains all existing data validation and saving logic
- No breaking changes to the authentication system
- All pages maintain their existing styling and user experience

The reorganization follows the user's preference for simple, step-by-step implementation with verification that everything works correctly.
