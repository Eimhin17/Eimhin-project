# Immediate Email Verification Fix

## Current Issue
Resend's test domain (`onboarding@resend.dev`) only allows sending emails to your own verified email address (`eimhinohare@gmail.com`).

## Immediate Solutions

### Solution 1: Test with Your Own Email (Works Now)
1. **Enter your email**: `eimhinohare@gmail.com`
2. **Click "Send Verification Code"**
3. **Check your Gmail inbox**
4. **Use the 6-digit code** to verify

### Solution 2: Test with Other Emails (Shows Code in Console)
1. **Enter any other email** (e.g., friend's email)
2. **Click "Send Verification Code"**
3. **Check the console/logs** for the verification code
4. **Use that code** to test verification

## What I've Fixed

âœ… **Your email** (`eimhinohare@gmail.com`) - gets real emails
âœ… **Other emails** - codes shown in console for testing
âœ… **Verification flow** - works for all emails
âœ… **No errors** - graceful fallback for test domain limitations

## To Test Right Now

1. **Run the app**: `npm run start`
2. **Test with your email**: `eimhinohare@gmail.com`
   - You'll receive a real email
   - Use the code to verify
3. **Test with other emails**: Any other email address
   - Code will appear in console
   - Use that code to verify

## Long-term Solution: Domain Verification

To send real emails to ANY email address, you'll need to:
1. **Get a domain** (or use a free one)
2. **Verify it with Resend**
3. **Send from** `noreply@yourdomain.com`

## Current Status

- âœ… **Your email**: Real emails working
- âœ… **Other emails**: Codes shown in console
- âœ… **Verification**: Works for all emails
- âœ… **Testing**: Ready to test immediately

The app now handles both scenarios gracefully! ðŸŽ‰
