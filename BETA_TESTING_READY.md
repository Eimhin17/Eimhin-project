# Beta Testing Readiness Checklist

## ✅ Email Verification System - READY

### What Was Fixed

1. **Removed Duplicate User Creation**
   - ❌ Before: Tried to create user twice (OTP + signUp)
   - ✅ Now: Uses existing user from email OTP verification

2. **Fixed Foreign Key Constraint**
   - ❌ Before: Referenced non-existent `public.users` table
   - ✅ Now: Correctly references `auth.users` table

3. **Proper Session Management**
   - ❌ Before: No session after signup
   - ✅ Now: Session established from OTP verification

4. **Password Handling**
   - ❌ Before: Tried to set password on non-existent user
   - ✅ Now: Sets password on existing OTP user

## 🎯 Current Flow (Production Ready)

```
1. User enters school email
   ↓
2. Receives 6-digit code
   ↓
3. Enters code to verify email
   ✅ Auth user created + email verified
   ↓
4. Completes profile (name, username, etc.)
   ↓
5. Sets password
   ↓
6. Accepts community guidelines
   ✅ Profile created in database
   ↓
7. Uploads photos
   ↓
8. Ready to use app!
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test with Real Email

1. **Start Onboarding**
   - Enter a real school email (e.g., your actual school email)

2. **Check Email**
   - Open email inbox
   - Find email from Supabase
   - Copy the 6-digit code

3. **Enter Code**
   - Paste code in app
   - Should show "Email verified!" message

4. **Complete Profile**
   - Fill in all fields
   - Upload 4 photos
   - Set password
   - Accept terms

5. **Verify Success**
   - Should navigate to main app
   - Profile should be created
   - Photos should upload
   - Can swipe on profiles

### Test with Testing Bypass (Development)

For quick testing, you can use:
- Any fake email (e.g., test@test.ie)
- Code: `000000`
- This bypasses actual email sending

## 🛠️ Configuration Needed

### Supabase Dashboard

1. **Go to:** [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)

2. **Navigate to:** Authentication > Providers > Email

3. **Settings:**
   - ✅ Enable Email Provider
   - ✅ Confirm Email: ON (OTP handles this)
   - Email template will be used automatically

4. **Fix Foreign Key** (Run this SQL once):
   ```sql
   -- Make sure profiles.id references auth.users
   ALTER TABLE profiles DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS profiles_id_fkey CASCADE;
   ALTER TABLE profiles ADD CONSTRAINT profiles_id_fkey
   FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
   ```

## 📧 Email Templates

The default Supabase OTP email includes:
- 6-digit code
- Expiration time (default: 1 hour)
- Your app name

You can customize this in:
**Authentication > Email Templates > Magic Link**

## 🎨 Username Restrictions

Updated to 15 characters max:
- Minimum: 3 characters
- Maximum: 15 characters
- Allowed: letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens
- Cannot start/end with _ or -

   - Check for failed verifications

5. **Prepare support**
   - Document common issues
   - Create FAQ for beta testers
   - Have a support channel ready

## 📱 TestFlight / Beta Distribution

The app is ready for:
- ✅ TestFlight (iOS)
- ✅ Internal testing
- ✅ Beta testing with real users

Make sure to:
1. Build with EAS: `eas build --profile preview --platform ios`
2. Submit to TestFlight
3. Share invite link with beta testers
