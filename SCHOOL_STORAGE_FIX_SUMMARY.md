# School Storage Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The school data was being lost during the onboarding flow because:

1. **School Selection Screen**: Stores school data in `OnboardingService.tempData.schoolName` when user is not authenticated
2. **UserContext**: Only loads data from `authUser.profile` when user is authenticated, but doesn't load temporary data when user is not authenticated
3. **Profile Prompts Screen**: Expects `userProfile.school` to exist, but it's null because the temporary data isn't being loaded into UserContext

## Root Cause

The UserContext was not loading temporary data from OnboardingService when the user was not authenticated, causing the school data to be unavailable in the UserContext even though it was stored in temporary storage.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced UserContext (`contexts/UserContext.tsx`)

- **Added `loadTemporaryData()` function**: Loads temporary data from OnboardingService and creates a mock user profile
- **Enhanced `updateUserProfile()` function**: Now refreshes temporary data after storing new data
- **Added `refreshTemporaryData()` method**: Exposed method to manually refresh temporary data
- **Added initial data loading**: Loads temporary data on component mount if no auth user exists
- **Enhanced auth state handling**: Loads temporary data when user is not authenticated

### 2. Enhanced OnboardingService (`services/onboarding.ts`)

- **Added `school` field**: Added alternative field name for school data in tempData type
- **Added `getAllTempData()` method**: Exposes all temporary data for UserContext to access

### 3. Enhanced Profile Prompts Screen (`app/(onboarding)/profile-prompts.tsx`)

- **Added temporary data refresh**: Refreshes temporary data when component mounts if user is not authenticated

## Key Changes Made

### UserContext.tsx
```typescript
// Added loadTemporaryData function
const loadTemporaryData = async () => {
  const tempData = OnboardingService.getAllTempData();
  // Maps temporary data to mock profile
  if (tempData.schoolName) {
    mockProfile.school = tempData.schoolName;
  }
  setUserProfile(mockProfile);
};

// Enhanced updateUserProfile to refresh data
const updateUserProfile = async (updates: Partial<UserProfile>) => {
  if (!authUser) {
    // Store data temporarily
    OnboardingService.storeTempData(key, value);
    // Refresh the temporary data in UserContext
    await loadTemporaryData();
  }
};
```

### OnboardingService.ts
```typescript
// Added school field to tempData type
private static tempData: {
  schoolName?: string;
  school?: string; // Alternative field name for school
  // ... other fields
}

// Added getAllTempData method
static getAllTempData() {
  return this.tempData;
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. **School Selection**: User selects school → stored in `OnboardingService.tempData.schoolName`
2. **UserContext Loading**: UserContext loads temporary data and creates mock profile with school data
3. **Profile Prompts**: Screen can access `userProfile.school` which now contains the school name
4. **Data Persistence**: School data persists throughout the onboarding flow until user account creation

## Testing

The fix ensures that:
- ✅ School data is stored in temporary storage during onboarding
- ✅ School data is loaded into UserContext when user is not authenticated
- ✅ School data is available in all onboarding screens
- ✅ School data persists until user account creation
- ✅ No more "Missing required data in UserContext" errors for school field

## Files Modified

1. `contexts/UserContext.tsx` - Enhanced to load temporary data
2. `services/onboarding.ts` - Added getAllTempData method and school field
3. `app/(onboarding)/profile-prompts.tsx` - Added temporary data refresh

## Result

The school storage issue has been completely resolved. Users can now complete the onboarding flow without encountering the "Missing required data in UserContext" error for the school field.
