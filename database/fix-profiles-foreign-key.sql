-- Fix profiles table foreign key constraint
-- =====================================================

-- 1. Check current constraint
SELECT
    tc.constraint_name,
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_schema AS foreign_schema,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
    AND tc.table_name = 'profiles'
    AND kcu.column_name = 'id';

-- 2. Drop the incorrect foreign key if it exists
ALTER TABLE profiles
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS profiles_id_fkey;

-- 3. Add the correct foreign key pointing to auth.users
ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD CONSTRAINT profiles_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- 4. Verify the fix
SELECT
    tc.constraint_name,
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_schema AS foreign_schema,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
    AND tc.table_name = 'profiles'
    AND kcu.column_name = 'id';

-- 5. Check if everything is working
SELECT 'Foreign key fixed! âœ…' as status;
