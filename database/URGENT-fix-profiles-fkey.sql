-- =====================================================
-- URGENT FIX: Correct profiles foreign key constraint
-- The constraint is pointing to public.users (doesn't exist)
-- Should point to auth.users
-- =====================================================

-- 1. Check what the constraint currently points to
SELECT
    tc.constraint_name,
    tc.table_schema,
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_schema AS foreign_table_schema,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
    AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
    AND tc.table_name = 'profiles'
    AND kcu.column_name = 'id';

-- 2. Drop the INCORRECT foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE profiles
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS profiles_id_fkey CASCADE;

-- 3. Add the CORRECT foreign key constraint pointing to auth.users
ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD CONSTRAINT profiles_id_fkey
FOREIGN KEY (id) REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- 4. Verify the fix
SELECT
    tc.constraint_name,
    tc.table_schema,
    tc.table_name,
    kcu.column_name,
    ccu.table_schema AS foreign_table_schema,
    ccu.table_name AS foreign_table_name,
    ccu.column_name AS foreign_column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name
    AND tc.table_schema = kcu.table_schema
JOIN information_schema.constraint_column_usage AS ccu
    ON ccu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY'
    AND tc.table_name = 'profiles'
    AND kcu.column_name = 'id';

-- 5. Success message
SELECT
    'âœ… FIXED! profiles.id now correctly references auth.users(id)' as status,
    'You can now create user accounts without foreign key errors' as message;
